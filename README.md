# Early Work Archive

This repository collects some of my early programming projects (2019–2023), done while I was in school.  
They're preserved here, but often do not follow best practices, are not very legible, etc.

## Projects

- [`pseudoprimes/`](./pseudoprimes/)  
  As a returning student at PROMYS Europe (https://promys-europe.org/) in 2022, my colleagues and I investigated the nature of a particular type of pseudoprime called Königsberg pseudoprimes. This file is a (very spaghetti-like) exploration of these pseudoprimes with code.
  
  The writeup we made at the end of the project is included; the interesting (non-background) stuff is in sections 4 and 5.
